//CONST & LET

const PI = 3.141592653589793;
PI = 3.14;      // This will give an error
PI = PI + 10;   // This will also give an error



var x = 10;
// Here x is 10
{ 
  const x = 2;
  // Here x is 2
}
// Here x is 10

// Const variable must be assigned when declared
// constant variable does not mean that the value assigned is constant
// this is becuase js sucks

// when you mark a variable const, it means it defines a const reference to a value

//let and const are similar, but let can be reassigned
// this means, constant primitive values cannot be change, but const objects can be changed
// but reassigning is not possible

//const keyword not supported in IE 10 or earlier
